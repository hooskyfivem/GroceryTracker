# GroceryTracker

This project is for tracking sales at any retail store that sells any type of product. This is one of the projects we already submitted, but I enjoyed making this one and I think it's really unique, and a great way to keep track of certain things. This can be advanced beyond imagination to be more useful than it even is now. I think that the hardest part for me was reading content from a file. I've never done that before in any particular work, or even in my own time to practice, but I think I've picked it up pretty well, and I can use it beyond this for many other projects in the future that will come in handy. Not only reading content from the file, but also creating another file and adding certain content into it. This can be helpful for data save files for games, or anything else really. I made this code readable by making it clean, and using clear-cut word terminology that clearly explains what this function does, or this variable does, etc, instead of naming it something random, or not entirely connected to what it actually does.
